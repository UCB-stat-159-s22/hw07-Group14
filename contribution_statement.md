## Contributions

- Catalina Villouta: perform the project analysis and create the main notebook. Develop genetools package and create the appropriate tests. Ensure that all the tests pass and everything runs without problems locally and on Binder. Finally, contribute to the README file and Makefile. 

- Claudea Jennefer: construct and deploy our Jupyter Book, create GitHub pages for the repository, and set up the GitHub action to automate the website on every push to the "main" branch. Additionally, fix the Binder environment problem.

- Gordon Tsai: create the environment yml file and discover how to install Tensorflow and Keras, so Binder works.  Write the LICENSE, include Binder badge, and ensure that everything runs appropriately on Binder.

- Wendy Kim: create all the Makefile targets and contribute to the environment file. Additionally, contribute to the README file to explain the project and ensure that Binder generates correctly. Wendy communicated to the team and faculty that, unfortunately, she has been unwell with COVID. Although that hindered Wendy's ability to contribute more, Wendy is incredibly thankful to the team for being so understanding. Wendy hopes this can be taken into consideration.

Overall, the whole group worked as a team, and all were involved and very communicative when doing the project.
